*setsyntax.txt*     Set options specific for the syntax group under cursor
                    Author: Tom Link, micathom at gmail com

This plugin sets options/variables according to the syntax under the 
cursor. It was originally created in response to 
http://groups.google.com/group/vim_use/browse_frm/thread/ff624d5a68f0a562 
and to solve a similar problem. While this plugin solves that other 
related problem it doesn't seem to work properly for tex files.
